# 📚 Library Docs Help

> This file is the single source of truth for documentation references.  
> AI agents **must always reference this file** before using or explaining any library.  
> Each key = library name (canonical).  
> Each value = link (URL) to the latest doc in the format (preferably a context7 “.llms.txt” file).  
> If the value is empty, the reference link is still to be filled.
