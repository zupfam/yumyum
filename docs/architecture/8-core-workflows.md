## 8.1 Authentication Workflow

Our authentication process primarily leverages Supabase's magic link functionality. The updated workflow is as follows:

1.  **User Initiates Login:** A user enters their email address on the login page.
2.  **Email Verification (Vendor Mapping Check):** Before sending a magic link, the system will check if the provided email address exists in the `public.vendor_mappings` table.
    - **If Email NOT Found:** If the email is not present in the `vendor_mappings` table (meaning the user is not part of the YumYum network), a magic link will _not_ be sent. Instead, an appropriate error message will be displayed to the user (e.g., "This email is not registered with YumYum. Please contact support if you believe this is an error."), along with a button to navigate back to the home page.
    - **If Email Found:** If the email is found in the `vendor_mappings` table, a magic link will be sent to the user's email address via Supabase.
3.  **Magic Link Clicked:** The user clicks the magic link in their email.
4.  **Successful Login & Redirection:** Upon successful authentication via the magic link, the user will be redirected to their specific vendor dashboard at the URL `/{vendor-slug}/dashboard`. The `vendor-slug` will be retrieved from the `vendor_mappings` table based on the authenticated email ID.
5.  **Session Management:** Supabase handles session creation and management.

This ensures that only registered vendors can access the system and are directed to their personalized dashboard immediately after login.
