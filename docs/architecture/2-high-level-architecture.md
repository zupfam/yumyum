# Section 2 of 18: High Level Architecture

## Technical Summary

The YumYum Premium Tier architecture is a modern, serverless, fullstack solution designed for scalability and developer efficiency. The frontend remains a **Next.js** application hosted on **Vercel**, providing a fast, responsive user experience. The backend is powered by **Supabase**, which provides a Postgres database, secure authentication (Magic Links), and auto-generated APIs. This architecture directly supports the PRD goals by enabling secure, multi-tenant vendor dashboards, CRUD operations on vendor data, and a clear path for future feature development, all while adhering to the "Free Tier Maximization" principle.

## Platform and Infrastructure Choice

- **Platform:** Vercel and Supabase
- **Key Services:**
  - **Vercel:** Hosting, CI/CD (Free Tier), SEO.
  - **Supabase:** PostgreSQL Database, Authentication (Magic Link), Storage, Auto-generated APIs.
  - **ImageKit:** Multi-account media hosting and optimization.
  - **Lark:** Webhook for critical alerts.
- **Deployment Host and Regions:** Vercel (Global Edge Network), Supabase (`ap-south-1` Mumbai).

## Repository Structure

- **Structure:** Monorepo
- **Monorepo Tool:** pnpm workspaces
- **Package Organization:** The existing monorepo structure will be maintained. New backend-related code (e.g., Supabase schema, RLS policies) will be organized within the existing project structure, likely in a new `supabase/` directory at the root.

    B_SSR -- Reads Mapping --> SP
    B_SSR -- Fetches Data --> F
    B_SSR -- or Fetches Data --> GS
    B_SSR -- Renders HTML --> U_Browser

    %% Authenticated Vendor Flow (CSR)
    A -- Login Request --> B_CSR
    B_CSR -- Calls Auth --> D
    D -- Sends Magic Link --> A
    A -- Clicks Link --> B_CSR
    B_CSR -- Verifies & Creates Session --> D
    B_CSR -- Authenticated API Calls --> E
    E -- Enforces RLS --> F
    B_CSR -- Image Uploads/Views --> G
    E -- Critical Failure --> H

## Architectural Patterns

- **Jamstack Architecture:** The frontend remains a pre-rendered application served from a global CDN, with dynamic functionality handled by client-side JavaScript interacting with the Supabase backend.
  - _Rationale:_ This ensures maximum performance and a great user experience.
- **Backend as a Service (BaaS):** We are leveraging Supabase to provide backend functionality out-of-the-box.
  - _Rationale:_ This dramatically reduces backend development time, allowing us to focus on the vendor-facing dashboard and features.
- **Row-Level Security (RLS):** All data access will be controlled at the database level using Supabase's RLS policies.
  - _Rationale:_ This is a highly secure and scalable way to enforce data isolation between vendors.
- **Client-Side Rendering (CSR) for Dashboard:** The vendor dashboard will be a dynamic, client-side rendered application.
  - _Rationale:_ This provides a rich, app-like experience for logged-in vendors.
