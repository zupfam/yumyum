# YumYum Premium Tier Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### 1. Goals and Background Context

#### **Goals**

- To launch a new recurring revenue stream by onboarding at least 5 paying vendors to the "Premium Tier" within two months.
- To validate that an in-app management dashboard is a high-value feature that improves vendor workflow, targeting a vendor satisfaction score above 8/10.
- To increase vendor engagement and menu dynamism by providing a frictionless, in-app editing experience.

#### **Background Context**

The current Google Sheets-based architecture, while effective for initial onboarding, presents a growth ceiling. It lacks the security and feature set (like secure logins and in-app management) required by maturing vendors. This PRD outlines the requirements for a "Premium Tier" MVP that addresses this by introducing a Supabase backend. This will power a secure, in-app dashboard where vendors can manage their entire storefront, solving their need for efficiency and unlocking a new revenue stream for YumYum.

### 2. Requirements

#### **Functional Requirements**

1.  **FR1:** The main landing page (`/`) shall be updated to include a marketing section advertising the Premium Tier.
2.  **FR2:** The system shall provide a secure login page for vendors using a Magic Link (passwordless) system via Supabase Auth. This login can be initiated directly from the `/login` page or via a modal on the main landing page (`/`). The login process must first verify the user's email against the `vendor_mappings` table. If the email is not found, the system shall display an appropriate error message. Upon successful login, the user shall be redirected to `/{vendor-slug}/dashboard`.
3.  **FR3:** A logged-in vendor shall have access to a protected, in-app management dashboard at `/[vendor_slug]/dashboard`.
4.  **FR4:** The dashboard shall provide CRUD functionality for all of that vendor's data, including their `brand` profile, `dishes`, and daily `status`.
5.  **FR5:** The application shall provide a UI element that allows a free-tier user to request an upgrade, which triggers a Lark webhook notification.
6.  **FR6:** The public-facing menu for a premium vendor shall fetch its data from the Supabase backend.
7.  **FR7:** The system shall track user interaction with the premium features via the specified Google Analytics events.
8.  **FR8:** The main landing page (`/`) shall include a clear entry point (e.g., a button or link) for vendors/admin to navigate to the `/login` page.
9.  **FR9:** The main landing page (`/`) shall include a "Top Vendors" feature section displaying the 10 most visited vendor pages, updated weekly from Google Analytics data.

#### **Non-Functional Requirements**

1.  **NFR1:** The entire system architecture must operate within the free tiers of all underlying platforms.
2.  **NFR2:** The backend architecture must support a multi-account strategy for Supabase and ImageKit.
3.  **NFR3:** For the MVP, vendor allocation to a Supabase account shall be a manual process.
4.  **NFR4:** The Supabase backend must enforce Row Level Security (RLS).
5.  **NFR5:** The vendor management dashboard shall be a Client-Side Rendered (CSR) application.
6.  **NFR6:** For the MVP, all subscription payments shall be collected manually.
7.  **NFR7:** For the MVP, all data migration shall be a manual process.
8.  **NFR8:** The authentication system must ensure a single user identity, linking new login methods to an existing user if they share the same verified email.
9.  **NFR9:** Comprehensive documentation must be maintained. A `/wiki` directory will be created at the project root to house all technical documentation, workflow guides, and user training materials.
10. **NFR10:** The "Top Vendors" list shall be automatically generated weekly via a GitHub Actions workflow, querying Google Analytics data from BigQuery and updating a static JSON file.

- **MVP Scope Appropriateness:** Just Right
- **Readiness for Architecture Phase:** Ready
- **Critical Issues:** None. The main risk to monitor is the "Free Tier Maximization" strategy.

### 8. Next Steps

#### **UX Expert Prompt**

> "Please review the finalized PRD in `docs/prd.md`. Your task is to create a detailed UI/UX specification and high-fidelity mockups for the new features, focusing on the Vendor Dashboard (`/[vendor-slug]/dashboard`) and the updated sales-focused landing page. Ensure the design for the dashboard is intuitive and efficient for a non-technical user."

#### **Architect Prompt**

> "Please review the finalized PRD in `docs/prd.md`. Your task is to create the technical architecture document for the Premium Tier. Pay close attention to the 'Free Tier Maximization' principle and the multi-account strategy for Supabase and ImageKit. Please define the implementation details for the Magic Link authentication flow, the database schema, and the APIs required for the vendor dashboard."
