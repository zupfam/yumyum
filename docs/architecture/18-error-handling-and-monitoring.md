# Section 18 of 18: Error Handling & Monitoring

This section describes our approach to handling errors and monitoring the application in production.

## Error Handling

- **UI Layer:**
  - **User Feedback:** When an operation fails (e.g., saving a form), the user will be presented with a non-intrusive toast notification or an inline error message explaining the issue.
  - **State Preservation:** Forms will preserve user input upon a submission failure, preventing data loss and frustration.
  - **Error Boundaries:** React Error Boundaries will be used to catch rendering errors in component sub-trees, preventing a full application crash and displaying a fallback UI.

- **Service & API Layer:**
  - Service functions in `/src/services` are responsible for catching errors from external APIs (e.g., Supabase, ImageKit).
  - Caught errors will be re-thrown as standardized application errors, which the UI layer can then interpret to display the appropriate user message.

## Monitoring

Our monitoring strategy is focused on three key areas:

1.  **User Behavior Analytics:**
    - **Tool:** Google Analytics 4 (GA4).
    - **Purpose:** To understand how users are interacting with the application, track conversion funnels, and measure feature adoption.

2.  **Application Performance:**
    - **Tool:** Vercel Analytics.
    - **Purpose:** To monitor Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) and overall application performance from the perspective of real users.

3.  **Critical Failure Alerting:**
    - **Tool:** Lark Webhook.
    - **Purpose:** To provide immediate, real-time alerts to the development team when a critical backend operation fails. This is reserved for severe issues that require immediate attention, such as a failure to connect to the Supabase database or a critical authentication error.
