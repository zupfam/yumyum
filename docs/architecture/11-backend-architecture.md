# Section 11 of 18: Backend Architecture

Our backend is provided by **Supabase** as a "Backend as a Service" (BaaS). We will not be writing a traditional backend application. Instead, we will configure and use the services provided by Supabase.

## Service Architecture

- **Serverless Functions:** If any custom server-side logic is required (e.g., for integrating with a third-party service that requires a secret key), we will use **Supabase Edge Functions**. These are Deno-based TypeScript functions.
  - **Function Organization:**
    ```plaintext
    /supabase/
    └── functions/
        ├── some-function/
        │   └── index.ts
        └── ...
    ```

## Database Architecture

- **Schema:** The database schema is defined in Section 9. We will use the Supabase UI and SQL scripts to manage the schema.
- **Data Access:** All data access from the frontend will be through the auto-generated PostgREST API. We will not be writing custom data access layers in the backend.

## Authentication and Authorization

- **Authentication:** We will use Supabase's built-in Magic Link (passwordless) authentication.
- **Authorization:** Authorization will be enforced using Postgres **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies. This is the cornerstone of our security model.
  - **RLS Policy Example (for `dishes` table):**

    ```sql
    -- 1. Enable RLS on the table
    ALTER TABLE public.dishes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

    -- 2. Allow vendors to see only their own dishes
    CREATE POLICY "Vendors can view their own dishes"
    ON public.dishes FOR SELECT
    USING (auth.uid() = vendor_id);

    -- 3. Allow vendors to insert dishes for themselves
    CREATE POLICY "Vendors can insert their own dishes"
    ON public.dishes FOR INSERT
    WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = vendor_id);

    -- 4. Allow vendors to update their own dishes
    CREATE POLICY "Vendors can update their own dishes"
    ON public.dishes FOR UPDATE
    USING (auth.uid() = vendor_id);

    -- 5. Allow vendors to delete their own dishes
    CREATE POLICY "Vendors can delete their own dishes"
    ON public.dishes FOR DELETE
    USING (auth.uid() = vendor_id);
    ```
